### What is Guess Bid?

A unique bidding and auction model for purchasing NFTs on ArtsArena. Just like a real-world dark-card auction scenario, buyers submit their bids without knowing the seller's target price. After the GuessBid ends, the buyer who is closest to the absolute value of the seller's target price above the reserve price will get the NFT, which is full of fun.

### Why should I use ArtsArena for GuessBid?

- For sellers, it can help me sell NFTs that I don’t want to sell at the floor price within a certain period of time, without having to passively wait for buyers.

- For buyers, GuessBid can help me have the opportunity to purchase NFT at a price lower than the market price.

### Rules for Guess Bid? What is a reserve price and what is a target price?

- Every bid in GuessBid is public, but the seller's reserve price and target price are in the form of a hidden price. Only bids above the reserve price are valid bids. Above the reserve price, the bid closest to the target price will be completed.

The reserve price and target price will be disclosed after the auction ends (3 days).

- Reserve price: The lowest psychological transaction price set by the seller.

- Target price: The best psychological transaction price set by the seller.
