# Overview

### What is ArtsArena?
ArtsArena is a blockchain platform that facilitates NFT transactions by operating NFT battle events and NFT betting.

The event is mainly a 1V1 battle between NFTs. All events will be decided by popular vote to determine the final outcome of the two sides, and the ownership rights of the loser's NFT will be transferred to the winner.

NFT betting means that sellers who are unwilling to sell NFT at the floor price and have a certain demand for sales list their own NFT in the form of a secret card. Buyers who speculate on the selling price will have the opportunity to obtain NFT at a lower price.

### What is the motivation behind ArtsArena?
By proposing a new way of playing the NFT market, we promote the liquidity of the NFT market and help sellers sell NFT.

### What are ArtsArena’s strengths?
- After the NFT participant wins, he will obtain the ownership rights of the losing NFT, which can be directly embedded in your winning NFT or held separately to increase the value of your NFT.

- The participation fee for NFT participants is 0 USDT - as a participant, you do not need to worry about registration fees or any other fees, and you can even enjoy the rewards of early participation in token airdrops.

- NFT voters can participate in the VotetoEarn mining activity.

- NFT sellers have the opportunity to sell their NFTs at the target price.

- NFT buyers have the opportunity to purchase their favorite NFT at a price lower than the market price.

- Whenever one of your NFTs wins or is traded, ArtsArena will charge a certain percentage of the transaction fee to share the appreciation with you.

### Will I lose money?
- As a non-custodial system, all tokens sent to the protocol will be saved and managed through algorithms without interference from any person or organization. This means your funds will only be subject to the rules stated in the smart contract code.

- If you participate in an NFT battle, the losing party will lose the entire value of the NFT, while the winning party may be able to increase its value exponentially (depending on the number of votes).

- By participating in GuessBid, sellers will sell their NFTs near the target price, and buyers will buy their favorite NFTs at a lower price than the market price. If the auction fails or the bid is invalid (lower than the reserve price) the money will be automatically returned to the account.

- Please note that despite the very careful review of our team's systems, we cannot completely rule out player losses caused by hackers or system vulnerabilities (see disclaimer).
