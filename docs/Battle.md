# Battle


### Why should I use ArtsArena for NFT battles?
- The NFT you win in the battle will likely increase in value. Once you win the battle, you will win the losing NFT.

- Your battle process is the display process of your NFT and collection. Even if the NFT in your hand is defeated, the NFT collection it belongs to is also displayed.

- The ArtsArena platform tokens you get from participating in the battle may appreciate in value (the NFT industry has entered the second half, the first half belongs to the producers, and the second half belongs to the circulation platform similar to ArtsArena)

### Why can my NFT increase in value after winning a battle?
Because when the Battle ends, the winner will obtain the ownership of the loser's NFT. The winner can embed it on the winning NFT, or hold it separately for free trading.

### What is the process of the battle?
- Initiate

  - Any player can activate a arena, wait for opponents to challenge, or directly participate in an existing arena.

- In battle

  - Use public voting for 24 hours

- After the battle

  - The party with more votes wins, and the party with less votes loses.

### Can I purchase NFTs in a battle?
No, onlookers cannot purchase NFT during the battle. They can only buy it at a fixed price after the battle.

### Is Polygon the only public chain that ArtsArena accepts for competition?
No, ArtsArena is an application built around the blockchain ecosystem.

Currently our application layer is located on Polygon. If your NFT is on the Polygon main network, after you authorize and pledge the NFT on Polygon, all future battles and transaction settlements will occur on Polygon.

When planning our future development blueprint, we also plan to expand to a wider range of application layer areas. After April 20, we will launch a plan to connect to Solana, so please stay tuned.
